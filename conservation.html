        Wildlife conservation in India is crucial for protecting the country's
        rich biodiversity. The establishment of national parks, wildlife
        sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves plays a pivotal role in safeguarding
        endangered species and maintaining ecological balance. Projects like
        Project Tiger and Project Elephant focus on specific species, showcasing
        successful conservation models. Community participation and awareness
        programs are essential components, as local engagement ensures
        sustainable coexistence. Sustainable development practices, responsible
        tourism, and addressing root causes like habitat destruction contribute
        to effective wildlife conservation. Overall, collaborative efforts
        between government, NGOs, communities, and the public are imperative for
        preserving India's diverse wildlife.

    <h2>Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972</h2>

    <div class="conserve">
      <p style="font-size: 25px">
        The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an Act of the Parliament of
        India enacted for protection of plants and animal species. Before 1972,
        India had only five designated national parks. Among other reforms, the
        Act established scheduled protected plant and hunting certain animal
        species or harvesting these species was largely outlawed. The Act
        provides for the protection of wild animals, birds and plants; and for
        matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. It
        extends to the whole of India. It has six schedules which give varying
        degrees of protection. Schedule 1 and part 2 of Schedule provide
        absolute protection - offences under these are prescribed the highest
        penalties. Species listed in Schedule and Schedule 4 are also protected,
        but the penalties are much lower. Animals such as common crows, fruit
        bats, rats and mice, are legally considered vermin and may be hunted
        freely. The specified endemic plants in Schedule 6 are prohibited from
        cultivation and planting. The hunting to the Enforcement authorities
        have the power to compound offences under this Schedule. Up to April
        2010 there have been 16 convictions under this act relating to the death
        of tigers.

    <h2>Project Elephant</h2>

    <div class="conserve">
      <p style="font-size: 25px">
        Project Elephant was launched in 1992 by the Government of India
        Ministry of Environment and Forests to provide financial and technical
        support to wildlife management efforts by states for their free-ranging
        populations of wild Asian Elephants. The project aims to ensure the
        long-term survival of the population of elephants in their natural
        habitats by protecting them, their habitats and migration corridors.
        Other goals of Project Elephant are supporting the research of the
        ecology and management of elephants, creating awareness of conservation
        among local people, and providing improved veterinary care for captive
        elephants.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Tiger"

    <h2>Project Tiger</h2>

    <div class="conserve">
      <p style="font-size: 25px">
        Project Tiger is a wildlife conservation movement initiated in India in
        1973 to protect the Bengal tiger During the tiger census of 2006, a new
        methodology was used extrapolating site-specific densities of tigers,
        their co-predators and prey derived from camera trap and sign surveys
        using GIS. Based on the result of these surveys, the total tiger
        population was estimated at 1,411 individuals ranging from 1,165 to
        1,657 adult and sub-adult tigers of more than 1.5 years of age. It was
        claimed that owing to the project, the number of tigers increased to
        2,603–3,346 individuals by 2018. In 2023, the 55th tiger reserve in
        India was declared in Dholpur-Karauli, Rajasthan, being the State’s
        fifth tiger reserve.
