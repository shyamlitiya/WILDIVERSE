    <h1><u>How Diverse</u></h1>
      <div class="species" >
        <p style="width:fit-content;">
          Within only about 2 percent of the world's total land surface, India
          is known to have over 7.5% of the species of animals that the world
          holds. The Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), with its headquarters in
          Kolkata and 16 regional stations is responsible for surveying the
          faunal resources of India. Possessing a tremendous diversity of
          climate and physical conditions, India has great variety of fauna,
          numbering 92,037 species, of which insects alone include 61,375
          species. It is estimated that about two times that number of species
          still remain to be discovered in India alone.

      <h2><u>Mammals</u></h2>
      <div class="species">
        <p>
          The mammals include the majestic elephant, the gaur or Indian bison -
          the largest of existing bovines, the great Indian rhinoceros, the
          gigantic wild sheep of the Himalayas, the swamp deer, the thamin
          spotted deer, nilgai, the four-horned antelope, the Indian antelope or
          black-buck - the only representatives of these genera. <br><br>
          Among the cats, the tiger and lion are the most magnificent of all; other splendid
          creatures such as the clouded leopard, the snow leopard, the marbled
          cat, etc., are also found. Many other species of mammals are
          remarkable for their beauty, colouring, grace and uniqueness. Several
          birds, like pheasants, geese, ducks, mynahs, parakeets, pigeons,
          cranes, hornbills and sun birds inhabit forests and wetlands.

      <h2><u>Reptiles</u></h2>
      <div class="species">
        <p>
            India's rivers and lakes host not only crocodiles and gharials but also a diverse array of amphibians, vital to the nation's aquatic biodiversity. 
            Frogs, toads, and salamanders thrive in the country's wetlands, notably in the biodiversity-rich Western Ghats, home to the endangered Purple Frog.
            While crocodiles symbolize reptilian diversity, amphibians add another layer to this
            rich tapestry. <br><br>
            Unfortunately, habitat loss, pollution, and climate change pose threats to amphibians.
            Conservation initiatives, akin to the crocodile breeding project, are crucial for their survival. Programs safeguarding wetlands and advo
            Acting as indicators of environmental health, these amphibians contribute to pest control, disease regulation, and nutrient cycling in aquatic 
            ecosystems. Preserving their habitats becomes paramount not just for the survival of these fascinating creatures but for maintaining the delicate
            balance that supports the overall health and sustainability of India's diverse aquatic environments. As India grapples with the challenges posed 
            by human activities and climate shifts, an enhanced understanding and commitment to amphibian conservation become indispensable for the nation's
            environmental stewardship.

      <h2><u>Amphibians</u></h2>
      <div class="species">
        <p>India hosts a diverse array of amphibian species, contributing significantly to global amphibian diversity. The Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot, is particularly rich in amphibian life. Notable species include the Malabar gliding frog (Rhacophorus malabaricus), known for its ability to glide between trees, and the critically endangered Purple Frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis), an ancient lineage endemic to the region. <br><br>    The Indian Bullfrog (Hoplobatrachus tigerinus) is widespread, recognized for its distinctive croaking calls. Threats such as habitat loss, pollution, and emerging diseases have impacted amphibian populations. Conservation efforts, including habitat protection and monitoring, are crucial to ensuring the survival of these unique and ecologically important species in the diverse landscapes of India.</p>

      <h2><u>Fishes</u></h2>
      <div class="species">
        <p>India boasts a rich diversity of fishes, contributing significantly to global ichthyological diversity. With over 2,500 species, India's aquatic ecosystems, including rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, host a wide array of fish species. Iconic freshwater species include the Mahseer, renowned for its size and sporting appeal, and the Ganges River Dolphin. <br><br>Coastal waters are inhabited by various species like Hilsa, Pomfret, and Bombay Duck. The vibrant coral reefs surrounding the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are home to colorful reef fishes. Threats such as overfishing, habitat degradation, and pollution impact Indian fish diversity, necessitating conservation measures.<br><br> Initiatives promoting sustainable fishing practices and protecting critical habitats are crucial for preserving the wealth of Indian fishes, ensuring the ecological balance and livelihoods of communities dependent on fisheries.</p>

      <h2> Birds</h2>
      <div class="species">
        <p>India is a birdwatcher's paradise, boasting over 1,300 species, making it one of the most avian-diverse countries. The Indian subcontinent hosts a myriad of colorful and endemic species. The Indian Peafowl, or Peacock, is iconic with its vibrant plumage. The endangered Indian Vulture and the Great Indian Bustard face conservation challenges. The Himalayan region is home to the vibrant Himalayan Monal and the elusive Snow Leopard. Wetlands harbor migratory birds like the Siberian Crane and the Greater Flamingo. Keoladeo National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned for its birdlife. The Indian paradise flycatcher, the Indian Roller, and the vibrant Sunbird add to the ornithological richness. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these diverse species and their habitats across India's varied landscapes.</p>
